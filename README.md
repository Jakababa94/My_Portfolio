MY PORTFOLIO

My Portfolio is an overview of who I am in the professional field of Software Engineering.

This repository  contains the code lines I used to create my portfolio website.
I used my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills to create a responsive website accessible through various platforms.
The website is divided into different sections, About Us, Education background, Interests, Projects, Interests, Skills, Services, and Contacts.
